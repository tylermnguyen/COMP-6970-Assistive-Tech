<H2>More info on legos</H2>
Like most kids, I grew up building legos. It was a good creative outlet for young kids, but I definitely started to grow out of it around the middle
of elementary school. What I find interesting is, Lego as a brand seems to have grown up with its core audience. Instead of focusing on
their main demographic of children, a lot of sets these days are aimed towards adults that used to build legos when they were kids.
